# Reusable Required CI Entry

## Summary

- Added a reusable workflow entry for the repository's effective required CI
  closure.

## Current State

- `.github/workflows/required-ci.yml` accepts only `workflow_call`, keeps
  read-only repository permissions, and runs the existing Linux unit-test job.
- The existing CI workflow and ruleset are unchanged.

## Next Steps

- None for this repository-local entry; campaign-level routing and ruleset
  activation remain outside this repository.

## Evidence

- `.github/workflows/required-ci.yml`
- `tests/test_required_ci_workflow.py`
- `actionlint .github/workflows/required-ci.yml`
- `python3 -B tests/test_required_ci_workflow.py`
